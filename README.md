# COPILOT (Cell preprOcessing PIpeline kaLlistO busTools) 

Single cell RNA-seq preprocessing tool for gene-by-cell matrices of UMI counts. The uitily and summary file offered by this tool is directly comparable to CellRanger 3.1, the tool developed by 10X Genomics. It is recommended to use the raw spliced and unpliced counts matrices produced by scKB pipeline as the input of COPILOT.

## Advantages over CellRanger 3.1

1. Since scKB and COPILOT incorporates kallisto, which is a read aligner using peudoalignment, they are about ~ 30 times faster than CellRanger 3.1 in processing time. 

2. If user wants to calculate RNA velocity or infer trajectory based on splicing dynamics in downstream analysis, then COPILOT along with scKB are the right choice, since together they produce spliced and unspliced quality-filtered count matrices. 

3. If user wants to use specific sets of genes that represent the signal of noise or low quality cells for cell-filtering, COPILOT offers such function.

## Caution

It is recommended to use the raw spliced and unpliced counts matrices produced by scKB pipeline as the input of copilot, and run copilot in the working directory that contains folder with raw matrices inside. Note that the folder name should be the same as the argument "sample.name". Alternatively, user can directly feed the matrices to copilot in R by filling in the arguments "spliced.mtx", "unspliced.mtx" and "total.mtx". Note that if "total.mtx" is provided, then please let the "spliced.mtx", "unspliced.mtx" remain as NULL, and vise versa.

COPILOT relies on detecting the distribution of cells enriched in mitochondrial expression (putative dying cells) to identify the initial filtering threshold for low quality cells. Thus, even though user is confident that the library does not contain dying cells, it is still required for user to provide list of mitochondrial gene IDs or a character pattern that is shared among those gene IDs (See argument "mt.pattern"). Alternatively, user can provide genes that represent the signal of noise or low quality cells.

If the algorithm detects no putative dying cells, the initial filtering threshold will then be set as what user feed to argument "min.UMI.high.quality". It is recommended to play around with this argument until the number of high quality cell remains after filtering makes sense.

For users that have scRNA-seq data of _Arabidopsis thaliana_ root, and wish to perform correlation-based annotation, please make sure that all necessary files are downloaded from folder named "supp_data".  

## Application 

One can find here codes demonstrating how some typical downstream analysis of scRNA-seq were performed on COPILOT-preprocessed data. The codes also demonstrate how analysis in [Shahan & Hsu et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.29.178863) were done.
